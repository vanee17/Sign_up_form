## Summary

- This project was created to solve a challenge using HTML CSS and JS to recreate the page to be displayed.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout of the site based on the screen size of their device.
- View the hover states of all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when submitting the `form` if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field name] cannot be empty "*.
  - The e-mail address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct e-mail address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"This does not appear to be an email "*.

### My process

- I started this project with the basic structure coded with HTML to create the various sections of the view, then added the organization and layout of the page with a CSS stylesheet and for the form development logic a js sheet was created for the functionality.

### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- FlexBox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

- In this challenge I reinforced the handling of logic and functionality with javascript.

### Continuous development

- My desire is to continue practicing and deepening in the world of programming to create more complex projects every day using complex tools, databases and back-end languages for better performance of each project.

### Useful resources

- Google Font
- Color wheel
- W3S
